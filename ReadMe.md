About:  The Campsites123 website allows users to search for campsites based on a user entered address.  On submission of the location a 
google map will populate centered on the submitted location.  Google map markers are then dynamically generated identifying the location of

amenities.  The search is limited to the Unite States, this limitation was introduced in part fullfilment of project requirements for the validation of user input.  The website will also provide user feedback if the search location is invalid.
